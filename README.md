# Advent of Code 2023

This year I decided to try two things
1. Actually finish the challenge and not drop it after a few days
2. Try implementing it in Rust

## Why Rust?
Most of my coding career, I've been coding in Python, but I've read about Rust way back in the 2016 and wanted to try it ever since. After some time and having to work with big data, and cloud functions, I first encountered how Python could become a performance bottleneck. Wanting some modern general-purpose performant languages in my arsenal, I started exploring Go, which I also get to use at my day job, but I still wanted to find out what Rust was all about, so I took the opportunity Advent of Code gives me to try it out.
